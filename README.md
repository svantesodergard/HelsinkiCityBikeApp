# Helsinki City Bike App Backend
## What is this?
Thank you for asking! This is my implementation of Solita's
[2023 Dev Academy Excercise](https://github.com/solita/dev-academy-2023-exercise).
It is paired with a frontend (hopefully, looking at *you* future me). In short 
I have certainly imagined that I have received an interesting
project offer to create a UI and a backend service for displaying
data from journeys made with city bikes in the Helsinki Capital area. For more
information of this projects purpose, please visit <https://github.com/solita/dev-academy-2023-exercise>.

## That's Amazing! How do I run it?
I'll give you a clue; *Container* your excitement. That's right! You are able to run it
containerized within Docker. Simply run the compose file:
`docker compose up`. Remember to set the password, either in the docker-compose.yml file *or* 
by creating an environment variable.

## No way I'm doing that!
That's OK, due to me being **extremely** humble and generous, I'll host this on an Oracle Cloud Free Tier Instance.
Hopefully you will find a link for that here in the future. 

## RTFM
If you upon installing feel completely clueless on what to do next; **DONT PANIC!** 
and feel free to read [the fastidious manual]().
